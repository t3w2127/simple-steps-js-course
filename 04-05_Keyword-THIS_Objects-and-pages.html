<h2>Exercise section</h2>

<!-- Exercise #1 
•Create an object called shoe.

• The object should have a property called size initially set to 5.

• Create two methods: bigger and smaller that increase or decrease the size of the shoe by 1, respectively.

• Remember to use the this keyword!

• When you’re comfortable, repeat it once more without looking at an example. -->
